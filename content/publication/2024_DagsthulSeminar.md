abstract = "This report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar Shapes in Graph Data: Theory and Implementation (24102). The seminar brought together active expert and junior researchers, both from academia and industry, to discuss the many open problems and research directions that arise from shapes in graph data, and, more generally, flexible and expressive schema and constraint languages for graph databases. The participants informed each other on how we perceive the research area, reported on the most recent results, discussed open problems and future directions, and in particular, four working groups were formed with promising intentions to work on new research and vision papers."
