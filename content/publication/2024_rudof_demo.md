abstract = "In this paper we present rudof, a Rust library for RDF and RDF Data shapes. The library can be used as a command line tool but it can also be invoked from different systems. The flexibility of Rust enables the creation of binaries in Windows, Linux and Mac, as well as offering Python bindings and WebAssembly components. The library supports ShEx and SHACL, as well as other RDF data modeling languages like DCTAP, offering conversion mechanisms between them. It can also be used to generate UML-like visualizations of those data models. "
